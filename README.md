# gpass2keepass
Converts GPass 0.5 password files into XML files suitable for importing into KeepassX 

GPass was a password manager for GNOME that is no longer available, so migrating away from it is probably a good idea.
Folders are currently ignored, but could be added without undue effort.

The import functionality is adapted from the Revelation password manager (https://revelation.olasagasti.info/), which also supports version 0.4 of the file format as well as folders.
